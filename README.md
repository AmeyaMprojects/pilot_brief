# Aviation Weather Briefing

This project is a web application that uses machine learning to generate briefing reports for aviation flights. The application is built using the following technologies:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Gemini API
- Flask

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1.  **Frontend**: A React.js application that allows users to enter flight details and view the generated briefing report.
2.  **Backend**: A Flask application that interacts with the Gemini API to generate the briefing report.


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Go into the  `pilot_brief` directory. and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key. You can get a free API key from the [Gemini API website](https://gemini.ai/api).
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
6. Go into the `Python` directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python dependencies.
7. cd Python and run `python route_weather_service.py` to start the Flask application.
8. Now you can use the application to generate briefing reports for aviation flights.
